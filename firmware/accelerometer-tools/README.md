# Accelerometer Sketches

The aim of using an accelerometer with vibration motors is to:
- Verify the latency of the system
- Analyze and equalize the frequency response of the motors

## Wiring

Using the ADXL345 accelerometer:

- VCC -> 3.3V
- GND -> GND
- X-OUT -> any input pin
- Y-OUT -> any input pin
- Z-OUT -> any input pin

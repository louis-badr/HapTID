# Accelerometer Sketches

The aim of using an accelerometer with vibration motors is to:
- Verify the latency of the system
- Have the same vibration intensity for given frequencies

## Wiring

Using the ADXL345 accelerometer:

VCC -> 3.3V
GND -> GND
X-OUT -> any input pin
Y-OUT -> any input pin
Z-OUT -> any input pin

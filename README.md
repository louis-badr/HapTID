HapTID is a study on how vibrotactile stimulation can improve manual dexterity in healthy subjects. In this repository you will find:

- Hardware :
    - The parts list and assembly guide of the device
    - CAD files for the 3D printed parts
    - Electronic schematics and PCB design files

- Software :
    - A pygame program for the study on healthy subjects
    - A script to generate the running order of the tasks and parameters for the study

- Firmware :
    - Arduino sketches for the study on healthy subjects
    - Arduino sketches to test motor vibrations using an accelerometer

You can also find a web interface to test the device at [https://louis-badr.fr/HapTID/](https://louis-badr.fr/HapTID/) and its source code in the `web_app` branch.

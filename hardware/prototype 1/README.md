# HapTID first hardware prototype

This folder contains the first hardware prototype of the HapTID project.
The design objectives of this prototype are:
- be able to produce sub-threshold vibrations on the wrist ranging from 0 to 500 Hz
- be able to produce supra-threshold vibrations on each finger
- be able to produce different signals simultaneously on all actuators
- has wired communication to reduce latency (this is an experimental prototype)

## Parts list

# Running order

This is a simple script to generate a running order for the HapTID user experiment.
The experiment is comprised of 4 series of tasks (CRT or FC) separated by short breaks.
The first two parts have wrist noise vibrations turned off, the last two have them turned on. This is done to prevent the possible short term lasting effects of stochastic resonance.
The parameters for each series are randomized to prevent learning effects.

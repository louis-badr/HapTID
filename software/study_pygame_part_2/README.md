# HapTID Study Part 2

## Goal: Assess the effects of sub-threshold wrist noise vibrations on reaction time

The main goal of this study is to assess the effects of wrist sub-threshold noise vibrations on reaction time.
The study is divided into three parts to:
1. Get the Stochastic Resonance (SR) vibration level by measuring the participant's Perception Threshold (PT) to noise at the wrist (set to 80% of the participant's PT)
2. Get the maximum finger vibration level (for confort) by assessing the participant's PT to 250Hz sinusoidal vibration on the index finger (set to 150% of the participant's PT)
3. Assess the effects of SR on reaction time with a Choice Reaction Time (CRT) task

## Setup
The participant is seated at a table in front of a computer screen, with the HapTID device installed on their non-dominant hand.
For the CRT task, each of their finger rests on a force sensitive button.
The participant wears earplugs to isolate them from the sounds the stimulators and the speaker can produce.

## Course of the study

### Perception Thresholds (approx. 6min)
To assess the participant's perceptual thresholds to different stimuli (1)(2), the double staircase method is used:
One after the other, a stimulus is emitted by the HapTID device.
The participant is asked to indicate whether or not they perceive the stimulus.
Depending on the response, the stimulus intensity is increased or decreased until a threshold is found.
Each assessment consists of a descending then ascending phase of stimulus intensity.

### Choice Reaction Time (CRT) task (33min45s without breaks)
The exercises are grouped by block according to the instructions (visual and/or tactile) and the presence or absence of sub-threshold wrist noise.
The exercises follow each other every 3 seconds.
The participant must press a key to continue, and can therefore take a break, every 25 exercises.
The course of the study is as follows:

1. Block without noise (sub-blocks in random order)(9x5x5x3 = 11min15s minimum):
    - No WS, visual IS, 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - No WS, tactile IS (click), 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - No WS, tactile IS (vibration), 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - Visual WS, visual IS, 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - Visual WS, tactile IS (click), 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - Visual WS, tactile IS (vibration), 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - Tactile WS (click), visual IS, 5 repetitions per finger (random order)  
    - Tactile WS (click), tactile IS (click), 5 repetitions per finger (random order)
    - Tactile WS (click), tactile IS (vibration), 5 repetitions per finger (random order)

2. Block with noise (sub-blocks identical to block 1 in random order)(11min15s minimum)

3. Control block without noise (sub-blocks identical to block 1 in random order)(11min15s minimum)

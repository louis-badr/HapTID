# WAV to HapTID

This code comes from the [pico-pwm-audio](https://github.com/rgrosset/pico-pwm-audio) repository by Robin Grosset with some modifications.

This script takes a wav file, resamples it and outputs a file formatted for the HapTID firmware.

To use it, install the dependencies, put a wav file in the same directory as the script, and run the script with python.

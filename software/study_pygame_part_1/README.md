# HapTID Study Part 1

## Objectives
1. Get the Stochastic Resonance (SR) volume level by assessing the participant's perception threshold to white noise at the wrist
2. Assess the effects of SR on sensitivity (index finger) to
    1. 80Hz sinusoidal vibration
    2. 250Hz sinusoidal vibration
    3. Clicks

## Setup
The participant is seated at a table in front of a computer screen, with the HapTID device installed on his non-dominant hand. Their index finger rests on the surface of a bone-conduction audio speaker. The participant wears earplugs to isolate them from the sounds the stimulators and the speaker can produce.

## Course of the study
The study aims to assess the participant's perceptual thresholds to different stimuli.
The double staircase method is used: One after the other, a stimulus is emitted by the HapTID device or by the bone conduction loudspeaker. The participant is asked to indicate whether or not they perceive the stimulus. Depending on the response, the stimulus intensity is increased or decreased until a threshold is found. Each assessment consists of a descending then ascending phase of stimulus intensity.
Assessments are performed in the following order:
1. Assessment of white noise perception threshold on the wrist
2. Assessment of perception threshold on index finger without SR to (random order for each participant):
    - 80Hz sinusoidal vibration
    - 250Hz sinusoidal vibration
    - Clicks
3. Assessment of perception threshold on index finger with SR to (same order as previous assessment):
    - 80Hz sinusoidal vibration
    - 250Hz sinusoidal vibration
    - Clicks
4. Assessment of perception threshold on index finger without SR to (same order as previous assessment):
    - 80Hz sinusoidal vibration
    - 250Hz sinusoidal vibration
